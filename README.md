### Rust - October 26 2024

A Rust program that plots a .png FFT plot of a .wav file. 

In the directory is an audio file named 'waves.wav' which is a recording of ocean waves. This type of audio source file is a rich source of diverse frequencies. You will need Rust installed on your pc - clone the repo, cd into fft-analyzer and type 'cargo run' - it should run the program and produce a .png of the FFT plot for the included .wav file.
